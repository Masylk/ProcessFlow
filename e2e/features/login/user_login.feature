Feature: User login

  As a registered user
  I want to log into the application
  So that I can access my dashboard

  # Scenario: Successful login
  #   Given I am on the login page
  #   When I enter a valid email and password
  #   And I click the "Log in" button
  #   Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
  #   And I should see a welcome message

  # Scenario: Failed login with wrong password
  #   Given I am on the login page
  #   When I enter a valid email and an incorrect password
  #   And I click the "Log in" button
  #   Then I should see an error message

  # Scenario: Attempt login with empty fields
  #   Given I am on the login page
  #   When I click the "Log in" button without entering credentials
  #   Then I should see validation errors for both email and password
