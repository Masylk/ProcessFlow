Feature: Header Controls and Navigation
  As a user
  I want to access workflow controls and navigation
  So that I can manage my workflow viewing experience

  Background:
    Given I am in read mode
    And I can see the header controls

  # Scenario: Breadcrumb navigation
  #   When I look at the header
  #   Then I should see breadcrumb navigation
  #   And I should see the workspace name (if applicable)
  #   And I should see folder names (if workflow is in a folder)
  #   And I should see the workflow name as the final breadcrumb
  #   When I click on a breadcrumb item with a link
  #   Then I should navigate to that location

  # Scenario: Edit mode navigation
  #   When I click the "Edit" button in the header
  #   Then I should be redirected to the edit mode
  #   And the URL should change to the edit mode URL
  #   And I should see the workflow editor interface

  # Scenario: User profile dropdown
  #   When I click on my user profile in the header
  #   Then I should see a dropdown menu

  #   And I should see "Help center" option
