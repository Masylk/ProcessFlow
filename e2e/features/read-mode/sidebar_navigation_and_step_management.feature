Feature: Sidebar Navigation and Step Management
  As a user
  I want to navigate efficiently through the workflow
  So that I can jump to specific steps and understand the structure

  Background:
    Given I am in vertical mode
    And I can see the sidebar

  # Scenario: Sidebar step hierarchy display
  #   When I look at the sidebar
  #   Then I should see all workflow paths organized hierarchically
  #   And I should see proper indentation for nested paths
  #   And I should see step icons and titles
  #   And I should see expand/collapse arrows for paths with multiple steps

  # Scenario: Sidebar step navigation
  #   When I click on a step in the sidebar
  #   Then the main content should scroll to that step
  #   And the step should be highlighted
  #   And if the step was collapsed, it should expand

  # Scenario: Path collapsing and expanding
  #   Given I have paths with multiple steps
  #   When I click the collapse arrow next to a path
  #   Then the path's child steps should be hidden
  #   And the arrow should change to indicate collapsed state
  #   When I click the expand arrow
  #   Then the child steps should be visible again
  #   And the arrow should change to indicate expanded state

  # Scenario: Active step highlighting
  #   Given I am progressing through the workflow
  #   When I am on a specific step
  #   Then that step should be highlighted in the sidebar
  #   And it should be visually distinct from other steps
  #   When I navigate to a different step
  #   Then the highlighting should move to the new step

  # Scenario: Sidebar workspace navigation
  #   When I click on the workspace name in the sidebar
  #   Then I should be redirected to the workspace dashboard
  #   And I should see a hover effect on the workspace area
  #   And the workspace icon and name should be clearly visible
