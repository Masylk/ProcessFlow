Feature: View Mode Management
  As a user
  I want to switch between different view modes
  So that I can choose the best way to follow the workflow

  Background:
    Given I am in read mode
    And I can see the view mode switch controls

  # Scenario: Switching to vertical view mode
  #   When I click the vertical view mode button
  #   Then the interface should switch to vertical mode
  #   And I should see all steps displayed in a scrollable list
  #   And I should see the sidebar with step navigation
  #   And I should see step expansion controls
  #   And the view mode button should show as active

  # Scenario: Switching to carousel view mode
  #   When I click the carousel view mode button
  #   Then the interface should switch to carousel mode
  #   And I should see one step displayed at a time
  #   And I should see navigation buttons (Previous/Next)
  #   And I should see a "Get Started" button initially
  #   And the sidebar should be hidden
  #   And the view mode button should show as active
