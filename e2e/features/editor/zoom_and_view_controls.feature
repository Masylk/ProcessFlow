Feature: Zoom and View Controls
  As a user
  I want to control the view and zoom level
  So that I can work effectively with workflows of different sizes

  Background:
    Given I am in the workflow editor

  # Scenario: Zoom controls functionality
  #   When I click the zoom in button
  #   Then the canvas should zoom in by a standard increment
  #   When I click the zoom out button
  #   Then the canvas should zoom out by a standard increment
  #   When I click the zoom percentage
  #   Then I should see a dropdown with preset zoom levels
  #   When I select "50%" from the dropdown
  #   Then the canvas should zoom to 50%

  # Scenario: Zoom limits
  #   When I zoom in to the maximum level
  #   Then the zoom in button should be disabled
  #   When I zoom out to the minimum level
  #   Then the zoom out button should be disabled

  # Scenario: Zoom to fit
  #   Given I have a large workflow that extends beyond the visible area
  #   When I click "Zoom to fit"
  #   Then the entire workflow should be visible
  #   And the zoom level should adjust automatically
