Feature: Canvas Interaction and Navigation
  As a user
  I want to interact with the canvas effectively
  So that I can navigate and work with large workflows

  Background:
    Given I am in the workflow editor
    And I have a workflow with multiple blocks

  # Scenario: Canvas panning and zooming
  #   When I drag on an empty area of the canvas
  #   Then the canvas should pan in the direction of the drag
  #   When I use the mouse wheel
  #   Then the canvas should zoom in or out
  #   When I use the zoom controls
  #   Then the canvas should zoom to the specified level
