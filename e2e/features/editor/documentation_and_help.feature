Feature: Documentation and Help
  As a user
  I want to access help and documentation
  So that I can learn how to use the editor effectively

  Background:
    Given I am in the workflow editor

  # Scenario: Accessing documentation
  #   When I click the help or documentation button
  #   Then I should see the documentation modal
  #   And I should see tabs for different block types
  #   And I should see "Step", "Delay", "Link", "Condition", "Merge", "Path Labels", and "End" tabs

  # Scenario: Documentation content
  #   When I open the documentation modal
  #   And I click on the "Step" tab
  #   Then I should see information about Step blocks
  #   And I should see "When to use" guidance
  #   And I should see "How to add" instructions
  #   When I click on the "Delay" tab
  #   Then I should see information about both Fixed Duration and Wait For Event delays

  # Scenario: Documentation search
  #   When I open the documentation modal
  #   And I enter "condition" in the search box
  #   Then I should see only documentation related to conditions
  #   And irrelevant tabs should be filtered out
