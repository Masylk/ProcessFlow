# Frontend Guidelines

- Use functional React components instead of class components.
- Apply Tailwind CSS for styling; avoid inline styles.
- Components should be modular and reusable.
- Maintain a consistent and clear component structure.
- Self-close components without children
- Use parentheses for multi-line JSX
- Develop reusable React components in TypeScript. The user have a component librairie, you can ask him the code base to search them if needed
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling. The user also have his own design system and theme, you must use `theme.js`
- Integrate Shadcn components for consistent UI elements
- Define and use TypeScript interfaces for component props and state where applicable
