# Frontend Guidelines

- Use functional React components instead of class components.
- Apply Tailwind CSS for styling; avoid inline styles.
- Components should be modular and reusable.
- Maintain a consistent and clear component structure.
- Self-close components without children
- Use parentheses for multi-line JSX
- Develop reusable React components in TypeScript. The user have a component library, you can ask him the codebase to search them if needed
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling. The user also have his own design system and theme, you must use [hooks.ts](mdc:app/theme/hooks.ts)
- Define and use TypeScript interfaces for component props and state where applicable
- Use the `useColors()` hook for accessing theme colors
- The pages you build must always be theme-aware
