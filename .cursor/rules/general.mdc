# General Coding Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all development.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability in all code.
- Ensure function and variable names are clear and descriptive.
- Use concise, meaningful comments for complex logic.
- **Function Size**: Keep functions small and focused (max **50 lines**, ideally **20-30**).
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do **one thing well**.
- **Parameter Handling**: If a function has **too many parameters**, refactor it to use an **object**.
- **Always handle errors gracefully**
- **Never expose sensitive errors** to the frontend.
- **Use logging tools** like Sentry for production errors.
- Follow clean code practices and SOLID principles.
- You always can ask the user to have more detailed explanations before answering completely.
