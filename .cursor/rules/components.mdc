# Components Guidelines

- **Use TypeScript interfaces** for all component props
- **Document props with JSDoc comments** for better code completion and readability
- **Functional components only**: Use `React.FC<PropsInterface>` typing pattern
- **Default values**: Provide sensible defaults for optional props
- **Prop naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for component props
- **Component size**: Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- **Documentation**: Include a brief description of the component's purpose above the component declaration
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling; avoid inline styles except for dynamic values. Components should be theme-aware.
- **Theme integration**: Use the `useColors()` hook for accessing theme colors
- **Icons and images**: Support both string paths and React components for flexibility
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handle edge cases and provide fallbacks
- **Responsive design**: Ensure components work across device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Follow ARIA best practices for interactive components
- **Event handling**: Use properly typed event handlers (e.g., `React.MouseEvent`)
- **Performance**: Memoize expensive calculations or rendering with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- **State management**: Keep state minimal and use appropriate hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`)
- **Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across different contexts
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for complex component logic
- **Naming conventions**: Use PascalCase for component names and files
- **File structure**: One component per file, named the same as the component
- **Develop reusable React components in TypeScript**: The user have a component library, you can ask him the code base to search them if needed.
- **theme**: The user have his own design system and theme, you must use [hooks.ts](mdc:app/theme/hooks.ts)
- Define and use TypeScript interfaces for component props and state where applicable.
