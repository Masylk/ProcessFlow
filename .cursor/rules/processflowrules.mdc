# Your rule content

Generate a complete, understandable, and high-quality codebase for a web application.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript; styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes
- **Database:** Postgres accessed via Prisma ORM

## Detailed Technical Requirements

1. **Project Structure & Configuration**
   - Clearly organize the project with directories for `pages`, `components`, `styles`, and `api`.
   - Include essential configuration files like:
     - `next.config.js`
     - `tsconfig.json`
     - ESLint and Prettier configuration files
     - A sample `.env` file with placeholders for sensitive values like database credentials and JWT secrets.
   - Use environment variables for managing sensitive data.
- If you create a file for the user, you must explain where the user should put it.

2. **Frontend Requirements**
   - Develop reusable React components in TypeScript. The user have a component librairie, you can ask him the code base to search them if needed.
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling. The user also have his own design system and theme, you must use `theme.js`.
   - Integrate Shadcn components for consistent UI elements.
   - Implement client-side form validation for registration and login forms.
   - Define and use TypeScript interfaces for component props and state where applicable.

3. **Backend & API Details**
   - Use Next.js API routes for server-side logic.
- Use Prisma ORM.
   - Write asynchronous database queries with error handling using try/catch blocks.
   - The user use Supabase for the authentication.
   - Use appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses for all API endpoints.

4. **Security & Best Practices**
   - Ensure input validation and sanitization to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
   - Follow clean code practices and SOLID principles.
   - Include inline comments to explain key parts of the code and architectural decisions.

## Additional informations

- The working methodology is iterative, you must propose what to do next to the user.
- You always can ask the user to have more detailled explanations before answering completely.
